# Service Registry
The need for a service registry in a microservice architecture arises due to the following reasons:

1.Dynamic nature of microservices: Microservices can come and go dynamically, for example, due to scaling, upgrades, or failures. Service registry keeps track of this changing landscape and provides up-to-date information about the availability of each service.

2.Load balancing: Service registry provides information about the current load of each microservice instance and can be used by a load balancer to distribute requests to the least loaded instance.

3.Service discovery: Service registry helps microservices to discover each other and enables them to communicate with each other. This is important in a microservice architecture where services are decoupled and loosely coupled.

4.Monitoring and management: Service registry can also be used to monitor the health of microservices and provide an overview of the system status.

So the service registry is an essential component in a microservice architecture as it provides a centralized way to manage and coordinate the interactions between microservices.

# Eureka Server : This is a service registry server in the Netflix OSS (Open Source Software) suite
And it is used to provide service discovery for microservices in a distributed environment. Eureka Server provides a registry of available microservices, allowing client microservices to discover and communicate with each other.
